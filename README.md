# PowerBI-Project
🚀 Call Center Analytics Project | Power BI
I recently worked on a real call center dataset for Salla, with the goal of turning operational data into clear, actionable insights using Power BI.


📞 About the Data
 The dataset covered call center performance metrics, allowing a deep dive into agent activity, call volume, response behavior, and overall service efficiency. Since this was real data, accuracy and clarity were key throughout the analysis process.


🔍 What I Did
Cleaned and prepared the data to ensure reliability
Modeled the data to support meaningful analysis
Created calculated measures and KPIs to evaluate call center performance
Analyzed trends and patterns to identify strengths, gaps, and opportunities
Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to make insights easy to explore for decision-makers


📊 Key Insights
 I focused on extracting practical insights that reflect real operational performance and can support improvements in efficiency, workload distribution, and service quality.


🛠 Tool Used
Power BI (data modeling, DAX, and interactive visualizations)


📈 Outcome
 The final dashboard delivers a clear, data-driven view of call center performance and supports smarter, faster business decisions.
This project reinforced my belief that good data analysis isn’t about charts — it’s about telling the story behind the numbers.
